  The Venue is about 40 mins from the center of Budapest near the M5 motorway in a rural setting. The venue has rooms to rent, you are welcome to stay on site. Please get in touch with Eszter if you need a room to be reserved so we can confirm the availibility and the costs with you. There are a limited number of rooms so please get in touch as early as possible. We can alternatively find accommodation close to the venue.
  If you are coming with a car, follow the Google Maps coordinates below. Once you crossed the bridge over the motorway, follow the signs "Deak Udvarhaz". There will be plenty of parking on site. 
  If you don't have a car and staying in Budapest the night before, we will rent a coach with a collection point in the city centre where we will pick you up on the big day around 2pm and drop you off next morning with the rest of the guests.
